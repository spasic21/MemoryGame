Card Flipping Memory Game

This game was creating using HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

The objective of the game is to flip the cards, make a matching pair in one turn, and ultimately flip all of the cards throughout the game.
If you are unable to make a matching pair in one turn, the cards will be flipped back and you will have to remember where the cards are after your mistake.
Be careful and good luck!
